## Section 1: Short Response

### Question 1
The kind of error it throws is Reference Error. 
It is thrown because currentStatus is only creted inside the let and eals blocks 
I removed let from if and else statement, and add them in 3rd line 

const react = (isReuben) => {
    let currentStatus
  if (isReuben) {
    currentStatus = 'Everything is just fine';
  } else {
     currentStatus = 'Time to panic.'
  }
  
  console.log(currentStatus);
}

react(true);

### Question 2
Micheal Jordan
Because bestplayer and thegoat poit to the same object so if we change best player name it will also change the Goat.name 
### Question 3

Paul is the hardest working person in the room
Laisha is also the hardest working person in the room
Because the theHustler inside the fuction is separate from the outside one.

### Question 4
The purpose of rest parameters is to allow a function to accept an indefinite  number of arguments by collecting them into a single array because it makes functions more flexible because they don't need to have a limited number of parameters, and it allows them to handle variable inputs, for example summing numbers. Rest parameters are indicated by three dots (...) before the last parameter. 
The syntax gathers all remaining arguments passed to the function into an array.
The rest parameter syntax allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array. This is particularly useful when the exact number of arguments a function will receive is unknown at the time of its definition


funtion sum(...numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);
}

sum(1, 2, 10); // 13
sum(5); // 5
sum(100, 200, 800, 1, 1, 1); // 1103;



### Question 5

The definition of scope is the accessibility of variables, functions, and other identifiers in a program. It determines where a specific code can access and use these declared elements.
Variables declared with "var" inside a function are only accessible within that function.
They are not accessible from outside the function.
let outside = "outside";

function test() {
  let inside = "inside";
  console.log(outside); 
  console.log(inside); 
}





### Question 6

Modules which hold code, like functions or variables, which can be reused in other files. They help organize code into smaller, manageable pieces.
the benefits of using modules in your code is break large programs into smaller, easier-to-read files, each module has its own scope, so variables donâ€™t clash

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

module.exports = { add };

### Question 7


### Question 8

The data type(s) I would use to represent a single item in the cart is an object because it item has properties (name, price, and quantity), which are best stored as key-value pairs. The whole shopping cart can be an array of these objects, so it can hold multiple items.
